                                    <h3>Following are the major objectives/deliverables:</h3>
                                    <br>
                                    <p> The aim of the proposal is development of Center for Design, Manufacturing and
                                        Testing of the system. Specific objectives of the proposal are:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li> • Design and fabrication of small scale energy harvesters</li>
                                        <li>• Design and fabrication of efficient energy storage devices</li>
                                        <li>• Synthesis of materials for structural health monitoring;</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>The demand for energy harvesting and storage products has been rising but
                                        industry has been unable to meet the product requirements and thus delaying the
                                        launch of this vital sector. At the same time new applications have emerged
                                        creating research needs to discover novel materials and conversion mechanisms,
                                        and invent micro-to-macro scale components, and systems. </p>

                                    <p>This strong demand however can be fulfilled by implementing advanced design,
                                        manufacturing and testing centers in various technical institutes across India,
                                        which is becoming high in priority. As IIT Mandi is growing rapidly irrespective
                                        of the disadvantages faced primarily due to the geographic locations, it is
                                        imperative to develop one such center at IIT Mandi. This is primarily to cope up
                                        with today's demand, since the Mechanical Engineering stream of IIT Mandi is one
                                        of the major branches in one of the pioneer Institutes of north regions of
                                        India, which must have the facilities in terms of the design, modern material
                                        manufacturing, machining and testing centre. Thus it will help the faculties of
                                        the Institute and especially of the mechanical engineering stream to train their
                                        students and contribute their research findings in academic as well as
                                        industrial communities by exploring this field of design, materials and their
                                        manufacturing and testing. This will be the further step in this direction in
                                        IIT Mandi with the introduction of the innovative design, advanced material
                                        manufacturing technology and their testing. It is very much expected that,
                                        development of such centres under the proposed project will come up with
                                        interesting solutions for material development and characterization not only to
                                        the industries in the north region but also to the society by creating new
                                        dimension of knowledge acquisition at par with global knowledge. Moreover,
                                        exposure of students and researchers in such an advanced area of materials and
                                        manufacturing and advanced testing may help in producing expert human resources
                                        especially from north for modern manufacturing industries and also brought up
                                        high quality researchers of future generation. </p>

                                    <p>The proposal for “Center for design, manufacturing and testing of the system”
                                        aims to develop facilities in the fields of design, advanced materials

                                    <p>The proposed laser machining facility will be used for machining exotic
                                        materials, micro machining, and material engraving and thus will be useful in
                                        the fabrication of energy harvesting prototypes. These facilities will be made
                                        available to the PhD, MS, MTech andB.Tech. students for their research and
                                        project works as well as for laboratory (product realization technology lab
                                        (IC141P) and Design practicum lab ( IC161P)) teaching. For last four decades
                                        laser machining has become quite popular in machining of thin to relatively
                                        thick sections of different difficult to machine materials with high accuracy.

                                    <b>2. Spark Plasma Sintering Setup</b>

                                    <p>Spark Plasma Sintering Setup shall be used for processing of defect free energy
                                        harvesting materials. Spark Plasma Sintering is a comparatively fast sintering
                                        technique which process the material with high heating rate, consequently
                                        prevents the coarsening and grain growth during process. In Spark Plasma
                                        Sintering, heating rates exceeding 300°C/min are easily obtained hence a
                                        temperature of 1160°C can be obtained in only few minutes. Thus, the process
                                        enables to fabricate diffusion/defects free advance materials. Presence of such
                                        facility will ensure fulfilment of our proposed objectives. These facilities can
                                        be made available to the PhD, MS, MTech andB.Tech. students for their
                                        research and project works as well as for laboratory (Experimental Research

                                    <b>3. Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer</b>
                                    <p>Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is a material testing technique that is widely
                                        used to characterize a material’s properties as a function of temperature, time,
                                        frequency, stress, atmosphere or a combination of these parameters. Dynamic
                                        Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is a technique where a small deformation is applied to
                                        a sample in a cyclic manner. This allows the materials response to stress,
                                        temperature, frequency and other values to be studied. The term is also used to
                                        refer to the analyzer that performs the test. DMA is also called DMTA for
                                        Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis. DMA works by applying a sinusoidal
                                        deformation to a sample of known geometry. The sample can be subjected by a
                                        controlled stress or a controlled strain. For a known stress, the sample will
                                        then deform a certain amount. How much it deforms is related to its stiffness.
                                        DMA can also measure the glass transition in a more accurate manner in
                                        comparison to thermal analyzer. This equipment will be highly useful for the
                                        characterization of different materials. This facility shall be extremely useful
                                        to our PhD, MS, MTech andB.Tech. students for their research and project
                                        works as well as for laboratory (Design Lab -1 (ME311P) and Strength of
                                        Materials and Structures ( CE301)) teaching.</p>


                                    <b>4. Low Capacity UTM</b>
                                    <p>In general, a universal testing machine is used to predict mechanical properties
                                        of materials in tension and compression, under various ambient and low to
                                        elevated temperatures as well as corrosive environments. This facility will be
                                        highly useful to find the properties of high performance advanced materials as
                                        well as composite materials synthesized. To be specific, this UTM can be used
                                        for mechanical testing of ceramics, functionally graded materials and polymer
                                        composites. This testing facility will be highly useful to test the energy
                                        harvester and storage components under different fabrication parameters. The
                                        data obtained from the testing machine will be used to optimize the process
                                        parameters. This facility shall be extremely useful to our PhD, MS, MTech
                                        andB.Tech. students for their research and project works as well as for

                                        Materials and Structures ( CE301)) teaching.</p>

                                    <b>5. Cold welding facility</b>
                                    <p>Cold pressure welding is a form of solid phase welding, which is unique because
                                        it is carried out at ambient temperatures. Most nonferrous metals can be cold
                                        welded, and while copper and aluminium are the most common, various alloys such
                                        as brass, zinc, silver and silver alloys, nickel, gold and many others have good
                                        cold weldability. Plated wires, including tinned copper, silver plated and
                                        nickel-plated, can all be welded. This facility will be highly useful to process
                                        the fabricated smart materials and polymer composites. These facilities will be
                                        made available to the PhD, MS, MTech andB.Tech. students for their research
                                        and project works as well as for laboratory (product realization technology lab
                                        (IC141P) and Design practicum lab ( IC161P)) teaching. </p>
                                    <p>Keeping this in view, establishment of advanced experimental facility for
                                        fundamental studies in the field materials and manufacturing and their design
                                        will be very much helpful for modern technology, in order to set up a base for
                                        long term research with wider perspective of energy harvesting materials and
                                        systems. In addition to this, we have experienced faculty members who will be
