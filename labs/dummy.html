            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>At present, Design Lab facilitates hands-on learning of Solid Mechanics (ME206) concepts to 5th semester
                Mechanical UG students, The lab experiments are related to destructive testing of materials to predict
                mechanical properties. It facilitate hands-on learning of Theory of machines (ME309) concepts to
                6th
                semester Mechanical UG students, The lab experiments validates the concepts of kinematic and dynamic
                theories of machine components under motion condition. Students can be able to validate and extend the
                theoretical knowledge into practical machine applications.It facilitate hands-on learning of
                vibration and oscillation concepts of machinery systems to UG students, The lab experiments validates
                the concepts of vibration under forced and damped condition. Students can be able to validate and extend
                the theoretical knowledge into practical machine applications. The structural analysis laboratory
                section has been designed to facilitate the practical study of structural response of basic structural
                elements, namely, the beam, column, rigid and pin jointed frames. The experiments are partly conducted
                on laboratory scale models and partly using virtual simulation. The computational facility available
                with the lab supports Structural engineering MS & PhD students as well

                Applications of gyroscopes include inertial navigation systems, such as in the
                Hubble Telescope, or inside the steel hull of a submerged submarine. Due to
                their precision, gyroscopes are also used in gyrotheodolites to maintain
                direction in tunnel mining.[4] Gyroscopes can be used to construct
                gyrocompasses, which complement or replace magnetic compasses (in ships,
                aircraft and spacecraft, vehicles in general), to assist in stability (bicycles,
                motorcycles, and ships) or be used as part of an inertial guidance system.

                <p>
                    Epicyclic gearing or planetary gearing is a gear system consisting of one or
                    more outer gears, or planet gears, revolving about a central, or sun gear.
                    Typically, the planet gears are mounted on a movable arm or carrier, which
                    itself may rotate relative to the sun gear. Epicyclic gearing systems also
                    incorporate the use of an outer ring gear or annulus, which meshes with the
                    planet gears.

                <p>
                    Fatigue test machines use static, dynamic, and fatigue tests to evaluate the
                    sturdiness of raw materials, components or finished products.Fatigue tests help
                    to determine a test sample's life expectancy under actual service loads in
                    real-world applications.
