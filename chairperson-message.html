                <h3>Chairperson's Message</h3>
                <p> School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering (SMME), IIT Mandi is focused on teaching and
                    cutting-edge research in the broad areas of mechanical engineering and materials science and
                    technology. SMME offers B.Tech. programs in Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science and
                    Engineering and General Engineering with strong emphasis on product realization and practical
                    learning. SMME also offers masters programmes in Mechanical Engineering and Materials science with
                    an emphasis on the study of energy systems. Along with that masters and doctoral research in broad
                    areas of materials science and mechanical engineering such as solid mechanics and design, thermal
                    engineering, manufacturing technology and materials science is also under the focus of the SMME.
                    <br>
                    We encourage high-quality research and training to the next generation of scholars for enabling them
                    to successfully cater to the needs of the industries and academia related to improvements in the
                    products and advancement in the fundamental knowledge related to mechanical engineering and
                    materials sciences. I invite committed and motivated students, and faculty members to be part of
                    this journey and make it more impactful.
