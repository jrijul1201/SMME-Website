    "description": "In the past few decades, utilization of energy resources has highlybeen increased due to largeneed. The available natural resources are mostly being used to serve the purpose. Most of the nonrenewablenatural resources (coal, petroleum and natural gases) have limited stock, and due to very fast consumptionrate, it may not be available in next fifty years. Therefore, the need of alternate resources of energy, whichcan fulfill our requirement without affecting the ecological and environmental conditions, are in high demand.Thermoelectric (TE) materials are one of the best source of clean energy, which is efficient in conversion ofheat energy into electrical energy. There are various applications of TE materials such as electroniccomponent cooling, electricity production from waste heat of automobiles, infrared sensor, etc. Thesuitability of any materials for TE applications is decided on the basis of their thermoelectric efficiency.This thermoelectric efficiency is defined in terms of a dimensionless parameter called as thermoelectricfigure of merit ZT=α2σT/κ, where α, σ, κ and T are Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermalconductivity and absolute temperature, respectively. Thus in order to characterize the thermoelectricmaterials one needs to know the temperature dependent behaviour of α, σ, and κ of the materials.From past five years our group is actively involve in developing low cost instruments for the characterizationof thermoelectric materials. In this direction we successfully fabricated Seebeck coefficient, resistivity andthermal conductivity measurement setups, which can provide good quality data from 300 to 625 K. We are alsosuccessful in fabricating a Z-meter which can simultaneously measure α, σ, and κ in the temperature range of300 to 625 K. We have filed a patent for this instrument. Our group is also in the process of developingvarious instruments like Vacuum Furnace, Hall-probe, Vacuum based hot-pressing system, etc., which will beuseful in studying the thermoelectric behaviour of materials and their utilization in fabrication of devices.Such efforts of developing the low cost instruments provide students a great opportunity to learn manypractical aspects of science and engineering. It reduces ourdependence to buy high cost commercialinstruments. And in long run, our consistent efforts inthe direction of developing scientific instruments areexpected to benefit the underprivileged61universities and research institutions through the transfer ofknowhow. If such efforts areencouraged, they will help in generating technical man powers in the country whichwill reduceour dependence on purchasing and maintaining the scientific instruments from abroad. Finally,itwill also help in developing useful devices for waste heat recovery and refrigeration.The main aim of thislaboratory is to provide an excellent opportunity to learn magnificence of science and technology bydeveloping scientific equipments and useful engineering devices.",

    "description": "The computational work in mechanical engineering isplaying a bigrole in many aspects as it helps to reduce the product development cycle,the failure risk, and the cost, and at the same time it improves the quality the product.However, the studentsin mechanical engineering have difficulty in visualising thatcomputational is equally important for them as it is for computer science engineers, thiscould be due to factthat there is no exclusive laboratory dedicated to computational inmechanical engineering. This laboratory would be an example for the importance ofcomputational in themechanical engineering",
